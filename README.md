## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| PHP         | **8.3+** (8.4 recommended)                |
| Composer    | 2.x                                       |
| MySQL       | 8.x (or MariaDB ‚â•10.6)                    |
| Node / Bun  | Node 20 **or** Bun 1.1 (for asset builds) |

### 2. Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/adityakdevin/budgetgen.git
cd budgetgen

# 2. Install PHP deps
composer install --optimize-autoloader

# 3. Copy env & generate key
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# 4. Configure database
#   Edit the .env file to set your database connection details:
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
#DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
#DB_PORT=3306
#DB_DATABASE=budgetgen
#DB_USERNAME=your_username
#DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# 5. Run migrations & seeders
php artisan migrate --seed

# 6. Build front‚Äëend assets
# Using Bun (recommended):
bun install
bun run dev        # For development
# OR
bun run build      # For production

# Using npm (alternative):
npm install
npm run dev        # For development
# OR
npm run build      # For production

# 7. Serve
php artisan serve  # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 3. Development Commands

The project includes helpful Composer scripts for development:

```bash
# Development server with concurrency (recommended)
composer run dev          # Starts: server, queue, logs, vite

# Code quality
composer run lint         # Run Laravel Pint formatter
composer run refactor     # Run Rector refactoring
composer run test         # Run tests + lint + refactor checks

# Testing
php artisan test          # Run all tests (Pest framework)
php artisan test --filter=CategoryTest  # Run specific tests
php artisan test tests/Unit/             # Run unit tests only
php artisan test tests/Feature/          # Run feature tests only
```

### 4. Testing Framework

The project uses **Pest PHP** (not PHPUnit) for a more expressive testing experience:

```php
// Example Pest test
it('can create a category', function () {
    $category = Category::factory()->create();
    
    expect($category)->toBeInstanceOf(Category::class)
        ->and($category->name)->not->toBeEmpty();
});
```

- Tests use SQLite in-memory database
- Database is refreshed between tests
- Feature tests cover FilamentPHP resources
- Unit tests focus on model logic and relationships

### 5. Environment Variables

Refer to **`.env.example`** for the full list. Key settings:

```dotenv
APP_NAME="BudgetGen"
APP_ENV=local
APP_URL=http://localhost

# Database
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
#DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
#DB_PORT=3306
#DB_DATABASE=budgetgen
#DB_USERNAME=root
#DB_PASSWORD=

# Mail (for reminders)
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525

## üíª Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- The project follows PSR-12 coding standards
- Laravel naming conventions are used throughout the project
- Use type hints and return types for all methods

### Multi-Tenancy

- The application implements multi-tenancy using a global `HasUserScope` trait
- All models that should be scoped to the authenticated user should use this trait
- Always ensure new models that contain user-specific data implement this trait

### Money Handling

- Money values are stored as integers (cents) in the database
- The `HasMoney` trait and `MoneyCast` are used to handle money values
- Always use these tools when dealing with monetary values to ensure consistency

### Relationships

- Follow Laravel's relationship naming conventions
- Use type hints for relationship methods (e.g., `public function categories(): HasMany`)
- Document relationships in PHPDoc comments

### Debugging

- Use Laravel's built-in debugging tools:
  ```php
  // Dump and continue
  dump($variable);

  // Dump and die
  dd($variable);

  // Dump, die, and debug
  ddd($variable);
  ```

- For more advanced debugging, the project includes Laravel Debugbar
